{\bf Bode and Phase Plots}  
\begin{flushright} 0.4 Marks each figure, including description. \end{flushright}
Figure 5: Bode Plot of either High Pass Filter or Low Pass Filter. See Fig.~\ref{fig:freq_response}. Composed by two lines: experiment (line A) $\&$ theory (line B). Line A: log freq vs log gain from the results from Table I or II, depending on your choice. Line B: 10 calculated theoretical points (log freq vs log gain) using the transfer function of the filter. The bode diagram you have from the soft panel may be included in the appendix only for comparison.\\  

Figure 6: Bode Plot of the Active Band Pass Filter. See Fig.~\ref{fig:freq_response2}. Composed by two lines: experiment (line A) $\&$ theory (line B). Line A: log freq vs log gain from the results from Table III. Line B: 10 calculated theoretical points (log freq vs log gain) using the transfer function of the filter (line B). The bode diagram you have from the soft panel may be included in the appendix only for comparison.\\  

Figure 7: Only one Phase Diagram of any of the three filters tested. It can be a screen shot from NI-Soft Panel or calculated from Excel, its your choice.\\

Figure 8: Optional. Oscilloscope screen-shot waveform of the audio experiment $v_in$ vs $v_{out}$.\\[0.1in]

\section{Discussion and Summary}
\begin{flushright} 1.0 Mark. \end{flushright}

Summarize your findings. Discuss any interesting result related to the materials used or to any claim from the introduction. Discuss your measurements using engineering terms (accuracy, precision, resolution, etc).  Give technical conclusions. Restate the main objectives and how or to what degree they were achieved. Describe some applications of your results and comment any possible recommended future work.



% if have a single appendix:
%\appendix[Proof of the Zonklar Equations]
% or
%\appendix  % for no appendix heading
% do not use \section anymore after \appendix, only \section*
% is possibly needed

% use appendices with more than one appendix
% then use \section to start each appendix
% you must declare a \section before using any
% \subsection or using \label (\appendices by itself
% starts a section numbered zero.)
